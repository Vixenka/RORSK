## [rorsk_comparer](/rorsk_comparer/)
Program which compares previous generated data by [rorks_generator](/rorsk_generator/) and output results in the console.

```
cargo build
```
in their directories.

> [!NOTE]
> For running [rorks_generator](/rorsk_generator/) you must have a Vulkan API driver.

And for run you must:
